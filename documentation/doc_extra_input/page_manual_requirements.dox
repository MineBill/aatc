<p>Angelscript version 2.30.0</p>
A c++ compiler that supports these c++11 features
-# std::conditional
-# header <atomic>
<p>Your angelscript engine needs a string registered (been developing with the official addon scriptstdstring)</p>
<p>There is no generic call convention interface available yet, so if your angelscript project was dependant on that, you can't use AATC yet.</p>
