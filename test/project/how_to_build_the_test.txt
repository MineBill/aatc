If there is no project file available for your platform, you can follow these steps to make a project that builds the test:

1. Link with the angelscript library (required version = 2.30.0)
2. add these include directories:
     <your_angelscript_install_dir>/angelscript/include
     <your_angelscript_install_dir>/add_on

3. add all the code files in aatc/test to your project
4. add all the code files in aatc/source to your project
5. add all the code files of angelscript addons needed, found in <your_angelscript_install_dir>/add_on/<addonname>
     scriptbuilder.cpp
     scriptstdstring.cpp

6. set the binary output / debugging directory to aatc/test/bin
     because the test must find the scripts and they are in aatc/test/bin/script
